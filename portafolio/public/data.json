            "description":"This was my first portfolio created using frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. At that time, my knowledge was very basic as I had just completed a full-stack course. During the course, which was conducted by the T.tec program at Egg, I learned the fundamentals of frontend technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Additionally, I also learned how to work with the backend using Java and Spring Boot. One notable aspect of the course was that it allowed us to work in teams in different groups, which changed in every class.",
